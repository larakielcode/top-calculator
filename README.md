# Welcome to my Simple Calculator Project

This simple project in JS is in regards to The Odin Project learning. 
I also would like to thank [@GeoDaoyu](https://github.com/GeoDaoyu) for contributing on my issues I encounter on this project. Thank you!

> [!CAUTION]
> 
* ~~I added a lot of console log in this project for debugging purposes :D Sorry in advance. Thank you!~~
* Console.log that serves for debugging has been removed.

> [!NOTE]
> 
* Refactor most of the original js script I initially created.
* ~~This is almost a working simple calculator aside from the percentage button~~
* This is now a working simple calculator.

IF you encounter any issues or bug in the project please dont hesistate to open an issue. Thank you!
