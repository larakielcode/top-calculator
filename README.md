# Welcome to my Simple Calculator Project

This simple project in JS is in regards to The Odin Project learning. 
I also would like to thank [@GeoDaoyu](https://github.com/GeoDaoyu) for contributing on my issues I encounter on this project. Thank you!


> [!CAUTION]
> I added a lot of console log in this project for debugging purposes :D Sorry in advance. Thank you!

> [!NOTE]
> Refactor most of the original js script I initially created.
> This is almost a working simple calculator aside from the percentage button
